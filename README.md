# Password-Generator
I decided to build this project during the Fall Semester of my Junior year after taking the Object-Oriented Effective Java Programming course. I wanted to build something interesting with Java to practice and see what I could do on my own. 

While working on it, I decided to include a password strength checker feature that checks the overall strength of the entered password. I was pretty happy with how it turned out, but I realized that it was not very straightforward to use for someone who does not know how it is supposed to work. So, I decided to create a GUI for the application for the next step, which is available in the Password-Services repository.
